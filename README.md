# Welcome to Speccy_Squad's Kata Challenges 😎
This is Task 2 in our 3 part challenge.
nb: These can be completed individually

You checked your fridge and some items are missing 😪 You will need to go to do some shopping but it looks like it's going to rain soon, so you want to buy everything from one shop (or maybe you're just a bit lazy, who are we to judge?). 

The items you need: 
- milk 🥛
- tomatoes 🍅
- broccoli 🥦

You already have a list of all shops in your area and what they have in stock.
- create a function that will check through all stores' inventory:
- if there is a shop that has all things you're after, returns the name of this shop;
- if there is no match, you should see a message like "Whoomp - whomp, looks like you might have to make several trips";
- if there are several stores with matching stock, show the name of all shops
