# Overview

This project is a simple yet fun exercise developed during my time in a coding bootcamp. The goal was to create a set of tests for a function - once the tests were created, I removed the original implementation, and a fellow bootcampers had to recreate it based solely on the tests. The project is a great demonstration of Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.




## Let's play!

You checked your fridge and noticed some items are missing üò™. You need to go shopping, but it looks like it might rain soon, so you want to buy everything from one shop (or maybe you're just feeling a bit lazy, who am I to judge?).

The items you need:
- Milk ü•õ
- Tomatoes üçÖ
- Broccoli ü•¶

You already have a list of all the shops in your area and what they have in stock.

The task:

Create a function that checks through all the stores' inventories and:

- If there is a store that has all the items you're after, it should return the name of that shop.

- If no store has all the items, it should return a message saying: "Whoomp - whomp, looks like you might have to make several trips".

- If multiple stores have all the items, it should return the names of all matching stores.
## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm must be installed on your machine.

- Vitest: This is the testing framework we used. If you don't have it installed, you can install it globally or as a dev dependency.

## Installation

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

Copy code
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
Running the Tests:

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npx vitest
```
This will run all the test cases defined in your project and show you the results.
```bash
  npm install my-project
  cd my-project
```
